# Inception42: Docker Installation and Containerization

## Installing Docker

Let's start by installing Docker. First, ensure your package manager is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Now, install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Next, enable and start Docker using the systemctl command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker --now
```

Check the status of Docker on your device:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

It should show as active (running). Now, verify the Docker version:

```bash
docker --version
```

Run a test using Docker:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

in the begining the developers were strugglingwhen they want to run an application on multi devices each one with its specific dependencies and its specific OS
hello
so in order to solve that problem the VMs comes to the point and suggest using an addition layer called the hypervisor to manage multiple OS in a single device
